I really enjoyed learning how to use Python this semester in class. Having a background in java and R I really wanted to be exposed to Python as I have heard that it is very popular withing the computer science community. 

The following are examples of how i learned to use Python in class: 

```{r}

```
```{python}
list1= [1,2,3,4]
list1[2]
list1[0]
list1[1:]

```

Using python we can have a vector and look through it and select certain positions that we want. List1[2] returns the third position in the vector while list1[0] return the first position. list1[1:] lists everything from the second position and onward. 


Python also has certain functions that we can use to manipulate our list
```{python}
list2 = [2,4,6]
list2.insert(3,8)
list2
```
By using the list function we were able to add the value 8 at the fourth position in the vector.
