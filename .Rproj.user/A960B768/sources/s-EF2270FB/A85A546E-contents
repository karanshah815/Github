I really enjoyed learning how to use Python this semester in class. Having a background in java and R, I really wanted to be exposed to Python as another coding language.
The following are examples of how i learned to use Python in class: 

```{r}

```
```{python}
list1= [1,2,3,4]
list1[2]
list1[0]
list1[1:]

```

Using python we can have a vector and look through it and select certain positions that we want. List1[2] returns the third position in the vector while list1[0] return the first position. list1[1:] lists everything from the second position and onward. 


Python also has certain functions that we can use to manipulate our list
```{python}
list2 = [2,4,6]
list2.insert(3,8)
list2
```
By using the list function we were able to add the value 8 at the fourth position in the vector.


Furthermore python allows us to compute mathematical analysis using function that are within numpy.
```{python}
import numpy as np

list3 = [1,8,9,10,11,16,13,77,68,18]
print("mean of list 3: ", np.mean(list3))

```
The mean function allows us to find the mean of the vector. By using print, we can also return the value of the mean after using a string. In this case I explained what the value being returned was as a string.
