I really enjoyed learning how to use Python this semester in class. Having a background in java and R, I really wanted to be exposed to Python as another coding language.
The following are examples of how i learned to use Python in class:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list1= [1,2,3,4]
list1[2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 3</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>list1[0]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 1</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>list1[1:]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [2, 3, 4]</code></pre>
<p>Using python we can have a vector and look through it and select certain positions that we want. List1[2] returns the third position in the vector while list1[0] return the first position. list1[1:] lists everything from the second position and onward.</p>
<p>Python also has certain functions that we can use to manipulate our list</p>
<pre class="python"><code>list2 = [2,4,6]
list2.insert(3,8)
list2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [2, 4, 6, 8]</code></pre>
<p>By using the list function we were able to add the value 8 at the fourth position in the vector.</p>
<p>Furthermore python allows us to compute mathematical analysis using function that are within numpy.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np

list3 = [1,8,9,10,11,16,13,77,68,18]
print(&quot;mean of list 3: &quot;, np.mean(list3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## (&#39;mean of list 3: &#39;, 23.100000000000001)</code></pre>
<p>The mean function allows us to find the mean of the vector. By using print, we can also return the value of the mean after using a string. In this case I explained what the value being returned was as a string.</p>
